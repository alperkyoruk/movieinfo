# Movie info with C
The project is my own C program for handling movie data. I have defined various structures and functions to manage and analyze movie information. The program reads movie data from a file and performs operations such as printing the budget array, the name array, and the genre list.

I have implemented functions to sort and print the movie list based on the year and rating, allowing me to easily view movies in chronological order or by their scores. The program also provides the ability to retrieve detailed information about a specific movie by entering its title. Additionally, I have included a function to calculate the frequency of each genre present in the movie data.

To interact with the program, I have created a menu-driven interface where I can select different operations and view the results. This project demonstrates my skills in handling data, manipulating arrays, and creating a user-friendly program in C.
